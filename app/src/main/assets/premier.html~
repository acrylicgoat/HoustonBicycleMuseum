Bianchi 1885- In Milan, Edoardo Bianchi began in 1885 repairing bicycles evolving into building cutting edge bicycles. Using a reparto corse (race Department) Bianchi was racing and proving their expertise by 1896 in races. The Grand Prix of Paris (predecessor to The Tour de France) was won in 1889. The recognition Bianchi was receiving from its Reparto Corse made the company one of the most popular brands in its industry. Bianchi, by 1914, was producing 45,000 bicycles, 1,500 motorcycles, and even 1,000 cars per year. In the 1960s Bianchi stopped production of cars and motorcycles to pursue bicycle manufacturing only. </p>
